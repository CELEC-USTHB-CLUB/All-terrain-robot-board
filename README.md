# All-terrain-robot-board
This is a line follower board based on ESP32 chip, the board can be programmed via USB connector, and we can control 2 motors due to L298N. Thanks to JLCPCB for the good manufacturing service https://jlcpcb.com/RAT and also for their good SMT service, also we want to thank them for providing us a sponsorship for our club.
